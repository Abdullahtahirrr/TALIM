If there exist cycles in the state space graph, this\r\ninevitably means that the corresponding search tree will be infinite in depth. Hence, there exists the\r\npossibility that DFS will faithfully yet tragically get ""stuck"" searching for the deepest node in an\r\ninfinite-sized search tree, doomed to never find a solution. • Optimality - Depth-first search simply finds the ""leftmost"" solution in the search tree without regard\r\nfor path costs, and so is not optimal. • Time Complexity - In the worst case, depth first search may end up exploring the entire search tree. Hence, given a tree with maximum depth m, the runtime of DFS is O(bm). • Space Complexity - In the worst case, DFS maintains b nodes at each of m depth levels on the fringe. This is a simple consequence of the fact that once b children of some parent are enqueued, the nature\r\nof DFS allows only one of the subtrees of any of these children to be explored at any given point in\r\ntime.

Hence, we desire a structure that outputs the oldest enqueued object to\r\nrepresent our fringe. For this, BFS uses a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue, which does exactly this. • Completeness - If a solution exists, then the depth of the shallowest node s must be finite, so BFS\r\nmust eventually search this depth. Hence, it’s complete. • Optimality - BFS is generally not optimal because it simply does not take costs into consideration\r\nwhen determining which node to replace on the fringe. The special case where BFS is guaranteed to\r\nbe optimal is if all edge costs are equivalent, because this reduces BFS to a special case of uniform\r\ncost search, which is discussed below. • Time Complexity - We must search 1+b+b2 +...+bs nodes in the worst case, since we go through\r\nall nodes at every depth from 1 to s.', 'Walk-through DFS Graph Search\r\nS\r\nG\r\nd\r\nb\r\np\r\nq\r\nc\r\ne\r\nh\r\na\r\nf\r\nr\r\nQ,Q,R,E,P\r\nQ,R,E,P\r\nR,E,P\r\nF,E,P\r\nG,E,P\r\nP\r\nQ\r\nR\r\nF\r\nG=Goal\r\nS,D,B,A,C,E,H\r\nS,D,B,A,C,E,H,P,\r\nS,D,B,A,C,E,H,P,Q\r\nS,D,B,A,C,E,H,P,Q,\r\nF\r\nS-D-B-A-C-E-H-P\r\nS-D-B-A-C-E-H-P\x02Q\r\nS,D,B,A,C,E,H,P,Q,\r\nR\r\nS,D,B,A,C,E,H,P,Q,\r\nR,F\n']","Depth-First Search (DFS) expands a leftmost prefix of the tree.

It's an iterative improvement algorithm used to find a good approximation to the global optimum of a given function in a large search space.

The process works as follows:  You start with a randomized initial solution.  A ""successor function"" generates neighboring solutions – solutions that are close to the current one.  A ""target function"" (or cost function) evaluates the quality of each solution. The algorithm iteratively moves to neighboring states, always accepting moves that decrease the target function (improve the solution).  However, it also accepts *worse* solutions with a probability that depends on a ""temperature"" parameter.  This probability is determined by the Boltzmann distribution, a concept from solid-state physics.

As the ""temperature"" decreases over time, the probability of accepting worse solutions diminishes.  Eventually, at very low temperatures, the algorithm behaves like a greedy hill-climbing algorithm, only accepting improvements.  The slow decrease in temperature is crucial; a slow cooling schedule allows the algorithm to escape local optima and find better solutions.  The analogy to annealing in solids is that the temperature controls the probability of escaping local energy minima, just as the temperature in metal annealing controls the probability of atoms escaping local energy minima to form a more ordered structure.  The algorithm is memoryless; it doesn't use information gathered during previous iterations.

What are the main components of a Decision Network?,"['CS 188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\r\nFall 2018 Note 7\r\nThese lecture notes are heavily based on notes originally written by Nikhil Sharma. Decision Networks\r\nIn the third note, we learned about game trees and algorithms such as minimax and expectimax which we\r\nused to determine optimal actions that maximized our expected utility. Then in the sixth note, we discussed\r\nBayes’ nets and how we can use evidence we know to run probabilistic inference to make predictions. Now\r\nwe’ll discuss a combination of both Bayes’ nets and expectimax known as a decision network that we can\r\nuse to model the effect of various actions on utilities based on an overarching graphical probabilistic model. Let’s dive right in with the anatomy of a decision network:\r\n• Chance nodes - Chance nodes in a decision network behave identically to Bayes’ nets. Each outcome\r\nin a chance node has an associated probability, which can be determined by running inference on the\r\nunderlying Bayes’ net it belongs to. We’ll represent these with ovals. • Action nodes - Action nodes are nodes that we have complete control over; they’re nodes representing\r\na choice between any of a number of actions which we have the power to choose from. We’ll represent\r\naction nodes with rectangles. • Utility nodes - Utility nodes are children of some combination of action and chance nodes. They\r\noutput a utility based on the values taken on by their parents, and are represented as diamonds in our\r\ndecision networks. Consider a situation when you’re deciding whether or not to take an umbrella when you’re leaving for class\r\nin the morning, and you know there’s a forecasted 30% chance of rain.', 'As we’ve done throughout this course with the various modeling techniques and algorithms we’ve discussed,\r\nour goal with decision networks is again to select the action which yields the maximum expected utility\r\n(MEU). This can be done with a fairly straightforward and intuitive procedure:\r\n• Start by instantiating all evidence that’s known, and run inference to calculate the posterior probabili\x02ties of all chance node parents of the utility node into which the action node feeds. • Go through each possible action and compute the expected utility of taking that action given the\r\nposterior probabilities computed in the previous step. The expected utility of taking an action a given\r\nevidence e and n chance nodes is computed with the following formula:\r\nEU(a|e) = Âx1,...,xnP(x1,...,xn|e)U(a, x1,...,xn)\r\nwhere each xi represents a value that the i\r\nth chance node can take on. We simply take a weighted\r\nsum over the utilities of each outcome under our given action with weights corresponding to the\r\nprobabilities of each outcome.', 'Note that we have omitted the inference computation for the posterior probabilities P(W|F = bad), but we\r\ncould compute these using any of the inference algorithms we discussed for Bayes Nets. Instead, here we\r\nsimply assume the above table of posterior probabilities for P(W|F = bad) as given. Going through both\r\nour actions and computing expected utilities yields:\r\nEU(leave|bad) = ÂwP(w|bad)U(leave,w)\r\n= 0.34 · 100+0.66 · 0 = 34\r\nEU(take|bad) = ÂwP(w|bad)U(take,w)\r\n= 0.34 · 20+0.66 · 70 = 53\r\nAll that’s left to do is take the maximum over these computed utilities to determine the MEU:\r\nMEU(F = bad) = maxa EU(a|bad) = 53\r\nThe action that yields the maximum expected utility is take, and so this is the action recommended to us\r\nby the decision network. More formally, the action that yields the MEU can be determined by taking the\r\nargmax over expected utilities. Outcome Trees\r\nWe mentioned at the start of this note that decision networks involved some expectimax-esque elements, so\r\nlet’s discuss what exactly that means. We can unravel the selection of an action corresponding to the one\r\nthat maximizes expected utility in a decision network as an outcome tree. Our weather forecast example\r\nfrom above unravels into the following outcome tree:\r\nCS 188, Fall 2018, Note 7 3\nA\nW\nU(A,W)\nUmbrella\nleave\nsun\n100\nleave\nrain\n0\ntake\nsun\n20\ntake\nrain\n70\nWeather\nW\nP(W|F=bad)\nsun\n0.34\nrain\n0.66\nForecast\npeq=\n?', 'This is much like the multi-layer perceptron,\r\nhowever, we choose a different non-linearity to apply after the individual perceptron nodes. Note that it\r\nis these added non-linearities that makes the network as a whole non-linear and more expressive (without\r\nthem, a multi-layer perceptron would simply be a composition of linear functions and hence also linear). In\r\nthe case of a multi-layer perceptron, we chose a step function:\r\nf(x) = (\r\n1 if x  0\r\n1 otherwise\r\nLet’s take a look at its graph:\r\nCS 188, Fall 2017, Note 10 3\n', 'Should you take the umbrella?
