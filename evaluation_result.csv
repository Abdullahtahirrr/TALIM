what is the phenomenon by ehich we sekct the attributes for machine learning?,"['your agent until the very end of development, and is the equivalent of a ""final exam"" to gauge performance\r\non real-world data. Naive Bayes\r\nWe’ll further motivate our discussion of machine learning with a concrete example of a machine learning\r\nalgorithm. Let’s consider the common problem of building an email spam filter which sorts messages into\r\nspam (unwanted email) or ham (wanted email). Such a problem is called a classification problem – given\r\nvarious datapoints (in this case, each email is a datapoint), our goal is to group them into one of two or more\r\nclasses. For classification problems, we’re given a training set of datapoints along with their corresponding\r\nlabels, which are typically one of a few discrete values. As we’ve discussed, our goal will be to use this\r\ntraining data (emails, and a spam/ham label for each one) to learn some sort of relationship that we can use\r\nto make predictions on new and previously unseen datapoints. In this section we’ll describe how to construct\r\na specific type of model for solving classification problems known as a Naive Bayes Classifier. To train a model to classify emails as spam or ham, we need some training data consisting of preclassified\r\nemails that we can learn from. However, emails are simply strings of text, and in order to learn anything\r\nuseful, we need to extract certain attributes from each of them known as features. Features can be anything\r\nranging from specific word counts to text patterns (e.g. whether words are in all caps or not) to pretty much\r\nany other attribute of the data that you can imagine. The specific features extracted for training are often\r\ndependent on the specific problem you’re trying to solve and which features you decide to select can often\r\nimpact the performance of your model dramatically.', 'Deciding which features to utilize is known as feature\r\nengineering and is fundamental to machine learning, but for the purposes of this course you can assume\r\nyou’ll always be given the extracted features for any given dataset. Now let’s say you have a dictionary of n words, and from each email you extract a feature vector F 2 Rn\r\nwhere the i\r\nth entry in F is a random variable Fi which can take on a value of either a 0 or a 1 depending on\r\nwhether the i\r\nth word in your dictionary appears in the email under consideration. For example, if F200 is the\r\nfeature for the word free, we will have F200 = 1 if free appears in the email, and 0 if it does not. With these\r\ndefinitions, we can define more concretely how to predict whether or not an email is spam or ham – if we\r\ncan generate a joint probability table between each Fi and and the label Y, we can compute the probability\r\nany email under consideration is spam or ham given it’s feature vector. Specifically, we can compute both\r\nP(Y = spam|F1 = f1,...,Fn = fn)\r\nand\r\nP(Y = ham|F1 = f1,...,Fn = fn)\r\nand simply label the email depending on which of the two probabilities is higher. Unfortunately, since\r\nwe have n features and 1 label, each of which can take on 2 distinct values, the joint probability table\r\nCS 188, Fall 2018, Note 9 2\nSPAM\nSPAM', 'The most common design for an evaluation function is a linear combination of features. Eval(s) = w1 f1(s) +w2 f2(s) +...+wn fn(s)\r\nEach fi(s) corresponds to a feature extracted from the input state s, and each feature is assigned a corre\x02sponding weight wi. Features are simply some element of a game state that we can extract and assign a\r\nnumerical value. For example, in a game of checkers we might construct an evaluation function with 4 fea\x02tures: number of agent pawns, number of agent kings, number of opponent pawns, and number of opponent\r\nkings. We’d then select appropriate weights based loosely on their importance. In our checkers example, it\r\nmakes most sense to select positive weights for our agent’s pawns/kings and negative weights for our oppo\x02nents pawns/kings. Furthermore, we might decide that since kings are more valuable pieces in checkers than\r\npawns, the features corresponding to our agent’s/opponent’s kings deserve weights with greater magnitude\r\nthan the features concerning pawns. Below is a possible evaluation function that conforms to the features\r\nand weights we’ve just brainstormed:\r\nEval(s) = 2 · agent_kings(s) +agent_pawns(s)2 · opponent_kings(s)opponent_pawns(s)\r\nAs you can tell, evaluation function design can be quite free-form, and don’t necessarily have to be linear\r\nfunctions either. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the evaluation function yields higher\r\nscores for better positions as frequently as possible.', 'CS 188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\r\nFall 2018 Note 9\r\nThese lecture notes are heavily based on notes originally written by Nikhil Sharma. Machine Learning\r\nIn the previous few notes of this course, we’ve learned about various types of models that help us reason\r\nunder uncertainty. Until now, we’ve assumed that the probabilistic models we’ve worked with can be taken\r\nfor granted, and the methods by which the underlying probability tables we worked with were generated have\r\nbeen abstracted away. We’ll begin to break down this abstraction barrier as we delve into our discussion\r\nof machine learning, a broad field of computer science that deals with constructing and/or learning the\r\nparameters of a specified model given some data. There are many machine learning algorithms which deal with many different types of problems and differ\x02ent types of data, classified according to the tasks they hope to accomplish and the types of data that they\r\nwork with. Two primary subgroups of machine learning algorithms are supervised learning algorithms\r\nand unsupervised learning algorithms.

We don’t want to change them all the same amount though.', 'We then proceeded to discuss an example of a supervised learning algorithm for classification, Naive Bayes’,\r\nwhich uses parameter estimation to construct conditional probability tables within a Bayes’ net before run\x02ning inference to predict the class labels of datapoints. We extended this idea to discuss the problem of\r\noverfitting in the context of Naive Bayes’ and how this issue can be mitigated with Laplace smoothing. Fi\x02nally, we talked about perceptrons and decision boundaries - methods for classification that don’t explicitly\r\nstore conditional probability tables.

If we correctly classify our data point, then do nothing just like in the binary case. If we chose\r\nincorrectly, say we chose class y 6= y⇤, then we add the feature vector to the weight vector for the true class\r\nto y⇤, and subtract the feature vector from the weight vector corresponding to the predicted class y. In our\r\nabove example, let’s say that the correct class was class 2, but we predicted class 1.

With the difference in the weights and weight updates\r\ntaken into account, the rest of the algorithm is essentially the same; cycle through every sample point,\r\nupdating weights when a mistake is make, until you stop making mistakes. In order to incorporate a bias term, do the same as we did for binary perceptron – add an extra feature of 1\r\nto every feature vector, and an extra weight for this feature to every class’s weight vector (this amounts to\r\nadding an extra column to the matrix form). Summary\r\nIn this note, we introduced several fundamental principles of machine learning, including:\r\n• Splitting your data into training data, validation data, and test data. • The difference between supervised learning, which learns from labeled data, and unsupervised learn\x02ing, which doesn’t have labeled data and so attempts to infer inherent structure from it.', 'Thus, given a new data point, we\r\ncan then extract the corresponding features, and classify the new data point with the label with the highest\r\nprobability given the features. This all, however, this requires us to estimate distributions, which we did\r\nwith MLE. What if instead we decided not to estimate the probability distribution? Lets start by looking\r\nat a simple linear classifier, which we can use for binary classification, which is when the label has two\r\npossibilities, positive or negative. The basic idea of a linear classifier is to do classification using a linear combination of the features– a\r\nvalue which we call the activation. Concretely, the activation function takes in a data point, multiplies each\r\nfeature of our data point, fi(x), by a corresponding weight, wi, and outputs the sum of all the resulting values. In vector form, we can also write this as a dot product of our weights as a vector, w, and our featurized data\r\npoint as a vector f(x):\r\nactivationw(x) = Â\r\ni\r\nwi fi(x) = wT f(x) = w·f(x)\r\nCS 188, Fall 2018, Note 9 8\n']","Feature engineering governs attribute selection in machine learning.

","The phenomenon by which we select attributes for machine learning is known as feature selection. This process involves identifying the most relevant features (or variables) from a dataset to improve the efficiency and performance of a model. Selecting the right features can significantly affect the model's accuracy and reduce overfitting, as well as the computational cost.For instance, in a classification task like spam detection, attributes such as specific word counts, text patterns, or other textual features may be chosen to train the model. This practice, called feature engineering, ensures that the data representation is optimal for the algorithm being used.Do you need more details on feature selection methods like filter, wrapper, or embedded techniques",0.916666667,0.833333333,0.777777778,0.848749161,,0.935120323
