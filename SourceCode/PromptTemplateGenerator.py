For instance, a model that memorizes training examples but fails to generalize is overfitting. A simple intuition is a student who memorizes practice questions but struggles with new exam questions.Example A real-world example of overfitting can be seen in credit scoring models used by banks.In this scenario, a machine learning model is trained to predict whether a loan applicant will default based on features like income, credit history, and loan amount. If the model is too complex, such as a deep neural network, it may learn to fit the training data perfectly, including irrelevant details or noise. This results in high accuracy on the training set but poor performance on new, unseen data (test set), as the model fails to generalize."
